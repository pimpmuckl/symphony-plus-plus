# Symphony++ Solo Session

Use Solo Sessions for ordinary single-agent work and lightweight parent
coordination inside a dedicated MCP-enabled Symphony++ config when the task
needs durable local planning memory without WorkRequest or WorkPackage
orchestration.

Do not use this as authority for assigned WorkPackages, WorkRequests,
architect orchestration, bound MCP planning resources, ledger-backed claims, or
merge gates. Use
`symphony-plus-plus-mcp:symphony-work-package` for WorkPackages and
`symphony-plus-plus-mcp:symphony-architect` for WorkRequest orchestration.

## Source Of Truth

The Solo Session ledger replaces local `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, and
`progress.md` for this task. Keep entries small and non-secret.
Do not create local `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, or `progress.md` files for
Solo Session state.

Never store raw API keys, bearer/GitHub/Linear/MCP tokens, worker secrets, raw
WorkKeys, access grants, private handoff payloads, access-grant verifiers,
secret hashes, secret-bearing commands, or claim lease internals.

## Tools

Prefer MCP tools from the `symphony_plus_plus` namespace when available in an
unbound session. The exposed tool names are:

```text
solo_attach
solo_show
solo_list
solo_record_task_plan
solo_append_progress
solo_append_finding
solo_record_decision
solo_report_blocker
solo_resolve_blocker
solo_record_validation
solo_pause
solo_resume
solo_complete
solo_archive
```

Otherwise use the wrapper:

```powershell
pwsh <plugin-root>/scripts/sympp-solo.ps1 -Help
pwsh <plugin-root>/scripts/sympp-solo.ps1 -ValidateOnly
```

Do not set `SYMPP_REPO_ROOT` to the caller/task repository. It is an optional
Symphony++ source-checkout override only, used when installed cache source hints
cannot locate the checkout that contains `elixir/mix.exs`.

By default the wrapper uses the shared local ledger at
`$HOME/.agents/splusplus/symphony_plus_plus.sqlite3`. Set `SYMPP_DATABASE` or
`--database` only for an intentional isolated ledger.

## Attach

Attach once near the start and retain the returned `solo_session.id`.

Derive:

- `workspace_path`: repo root from `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, else
  absolute current directory.
- `repo`: stable remote slug or directory name.
- `base_branch`: assigned target base, upstream/default branch, or current
  branch as fallback.
- `caller_id`: stable local id like `codex:<repo>:<workspace-leaf>`.
- `title`: short task title.

```powershell
pwsh <plugin-root>/scripts/sympp-solo.ps1 attach `
  --repo <repo> --base-branch <base> --workspace-path <path> `
  --caller-id <caller> --title "<task title>"
```

## Record

Record only meaningful state changes. Use non-secret idempotency keys.
Entry bodies are human-facing Markdown; keep summaries and status labels plain.

Use intent-shaped commands rather than choosing raw entry kinds:

- `plan` / `solo_record_task_plan`: phases, strategy changes, current next steps.
- `progress` / `solo_append_progress`: implementation step, handoff, or status update.
- `finding` / `solo_append_finding`: durable discovery, root cause, rejected hypothesis, evidence.
- `decision` / `solo_record_decision`: local technical decision with rationale.
- `blocker` / `solo_report_blocker`: active issue requiring user/operator input.
- `resolve-blocker` / `solo_resolve_blocker`: append-only blocker resolution by `blocker_id`.
- `validation` / `solo_record_validation`: command result, blocked validation, residual risk.

```powershell
pwsh <plugin-root>/scripts/sympp-solo.ps1 progress `
  --session-id <id> --summary "Implemented Solo helper surface" `
  --status active --idempotency-key "solo:<id>:progress:helpers"

pwsh <plugin-root>/scripts/sympp-solo.ps1 validation `
  --session-id <id> --summary "Focused tests passed" `
  --result passed --command "<command>" `
  --idempotency-key "solo:<id>:validation:focused"
```

Keep large logs out of the ledger; summarize and reference local files if
needed.

## Read And Lifecycle

Use `show` after pauses, before major decisions, and before final response.
Use `list` to recover active sessions by repo/base/workspace/caller.
When using MCP tools, close or move sessions with `solo_pause`, `solo_resume`,
`solo_complete`, or `solo_archive`. The tool reads the current status itself.

Lifecycle:

- `active`: work in progress.
- `paused`: intentionally stopped but resumable.
- `completed`: requested work done and validation/review status recorded.
- `archived`: stale or no-longer-needed history.

```powershell
pwsh <plugin-root>/scripts/sympp-solo.ps1 show --session-id <id>
pwsh <plugin-root>/scripts/sympp-solo.ps1 complete --session-id <id>
```
