# Symphony++

Symphony++ gives Codex agents a local planning board, MCP tools, and a
dashboard for coordinating real work across WorkRequests, WorkPackages,
reviews, blockers, and delivery evidence.

Use it through the Codex marketplace. The installed plugin owns the runtime;
normal Codex sessions should not point at this source checkout, a worktree, or
local cache overrides.

## Install

Add the marketplace once:

```powershell
codex plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Pimpmuckl/symphony-plus-plus --ref main
```

Install the default skill-only plugin for ordinary planning:

```powershell
codex plugin add symphony-plus-plus@symphony-plus-plus
```

Install the MCP companion for dedicated WorkRequest or WorkPackage sessions:

```powershell
codex plugin add symphony-plus-plus-mcp@symphony-plus-plus
```

Update installed packages:

```powershell
codex plugin marketplace upgrade
```

Restart or open a fresh Codex session after installing or upgrading so Codex
loads the new plugin metadata. Do not install both plugins in the same Codex
home unless you intentionally want both skill prefixes visible.

## Dashboard

When the MCP companion starts, it launches or reuses the local Symphony++
runtime.

Open the dashboard at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:19998/sympp/board
```

The MCP endpoint is:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:19998/mcp
```

Installed artifact runtimes serve the packaged dashboard from the backend on
`19998`. A separate `19999` dashboard listener is only expected for explicit
source/Vite development runs or custom `SYMPP_DASHBOARD_ORIGIN` setups.

If the default ports are busy, the launcher records the actual URLs here:

```text
%USERPROFILE%\.agents\splusplus\runtime\codex-plugin.json
```

## Features

- Solo Sessions: lightweight local planning memory for normal single-agent
  work.
- WorkRequests: product-facing work with decisions, comments, planned slices,
  and delivery status.
- WorkPackages: scoped execution records for agents, including branch, PR,
  validation, blocker, review, and readiness evidence.
- Architect flows: split larger requests, dispatch workers, answer guidance,
  and close delivery cleanly.
- Dashboard: scan active work, blockers, PRs, reviews, and runtime status from
  one local page.
- Marketplace runtime: installed sessions use the marketplace cache and
  runtime artifacts instead of compiling from a developer checkout.
