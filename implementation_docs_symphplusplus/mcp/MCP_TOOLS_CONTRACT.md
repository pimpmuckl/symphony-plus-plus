`claim_work_key` requires `secret` and `claimed_by`. Reconnects are accepted
only when the same owner identity presents the same secret proof.

`attach_branch` requires `branch` and `head_sha`. When no PR head is attached,
review packages are matched to the latest attached branch head so stale
branch-only reviews cannot satisfy readiness after new commits.

`submit_review_package` requires explicit `head_sha` on every submission. For
readiness, the latest review package for the current head is authoritative;
older packages for that same head are superseded.
