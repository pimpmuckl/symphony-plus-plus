# MCP Tools Contract

This document mirrors `mcp_tools_contract.json` in readable form.

## Worker tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| claim_work_key | Claim a one-time work key/secret with required `claimed_by` owner identity and bind it to the current worker session. |
| get_current_assignment | Return the scoped assignment for the bound grant. |
| read_context | Read context.md for the current work package. |
| read_task_plan | Read task_plan.md for the current work package. |
| update_task_plan | Patch the plan with optimistic concurrency. |
| append_finding | Append a finding to the current work package. |
| append_progress | Append a progress event to the current work package. |
| set_status | Request a valid state transition. |
| report_blocker | Record an active blocker. |
| request_scope_expansion | Request broader scope; does not approve it. |
| attach_branch | Attach branch metadata with the current branch head SHA. |
| attach_pr | Attach PR metadata. |
| submit_review_package | Attach summary/tests/artifacts for the current head review package. |
| mark_ready | Move to ready state only if gates pass. |

`claim_work_key` requires `secret` and `claimed_by`. Reconnects are accepted
only when the same owner identity presents the same secret proof.

`attach_branch` requires `branch` and `head_sha`. When no PR head is attached,
review packages are matched to the latest attached branch head so stale
branch-only reviews cannot satisfy readiness after new commits. If branch and
PR metadata disagree, the latest branch head remains the current code head and
merge readiness waits for PR metadata for that head.

`submit_review_package` requires explicit `head_sha` on every submission. For
readiness, the latest review package for the current head is authoritative;
older packages for that same head are superseded.

Once `mark_ready` succeeds, worker evidence for that package is immutable: new
progress, finding, blocker, branch/PR, scope-request, and review-package writes
return `already_ready`, while idempotent replays of previously recorded writes
remain available.

For non-merge-gated policies such as `quick_fix`, generic `append_progress`
events can satisfy focused-test and review-lane readiness by recording statuses
`tests_passed` and `<review_lane>_green`, for example `review_t1_green`.
Tool-owned metadata, blocker, status, and scope events are ignored for these
fallback gates. Merge-gated packages still use current-head
`submit_review_package` evidence and persisted review artifacts.

For investigation policies, `request_scope_expansion` records the required
scope recommendation evidence but never approves the expansion itself.
