# SYMPP-V2-DOGFOOD-002 Child B Handoff Evidence

Date: 2026-05-18

## Scope

Child B records how the second tiny child slice consumes the outcome of child A.
The change is intentionally docs/evidence-only and limited to this file.

## Upstream Child Outcome

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Upstream child PR | `https://github.com/Pimpmuckl/symphony-plus-plus/pull/162` |
| Upstream merge SHA | `9be966822e34e6bcf731e157479a6813beb5741d` |
| Upstream evidence file | `implementation_docs_symphplusplus/dogfood/SYMPP-V2-DOGFOOD-002-child-a-naming.md` |

Child A established the rehearsal naming convention:

- WorkRequest: `SYMPP-V2-DOGFOOD-002-WR`
- Slice A: `SYMPP-V2-DOGFOOD-002-SLICE-A`
- Slice B: `SYMPP-V2-DOGFOOD-002-SLICE-B`
- Branches: `feat/sympp-v2-dogfood-002-child-a` and `feat/sympp-v2-dogfood-002-child-b`

## Child B Mapping

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Planned slice | `SYMPP-V2-DOGFOOD-002-SLICE-B` |
| Dispatched WorkPackage | `wp_sHfN93m9r_YI13w7TOqeXw` |
| Branch | `feat/sympp-v2-dogfood-002-child-b` |
| Owned file | `implementation_docs_symphplusplus/dogfood/SYMPP-V2-DOGFOOD-002-child-b-handoff.md` |

## Rehearsal Signal

The second child slice started from `main` after child A landed. That gives the
final DOGFOOD-002 evidence PR a concrete two-step merge sequence to report:

1. Child A established the convention.
2. Child B consumed that convention from the updated base.

No runtime, plugin, workflow, or secret-bearing files are part of this slice.
